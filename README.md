Single point mobile based payment
Millennials, those born between 1980 and 1999 are strong supporters of new technology.
A study conducted by JWT revealed 62 percent of millennials surveyed 
would prefer to pay using their mobile phone than with cash, particularly for smaller purchases.

Why they want Mobile Payment

Top 3 Reasons 
		1. To Speed up Transactions    				 
		2. To Split bills or Expense with Friends  	 
		3. There was no line to Stand 				 
		
		
We would like to take to Verizon nextlevel , The Solution provider for the Millennials.
We developed the new Verizon One point payment solution for the New Gen Smart phone users. 

How it is Different from Traditional Debit / Credit Cards ?

		1. No need to carry a Physical card.
		2. No need to share the card number or name to the cahsier
		3. Amount can be paid using the NFC  (Near Field Communication) antenna 
		4. We can load cash from more than one card or bank accounts.
		
		
How it is Different from Google Wallet or any other mobile wallets ?

		1. Google and Paypal dont own the  device and they are not the service provider. They depending on 3rd parties.
		2. Verizon has both and we can provide the better service and offers to customers
		3. Major US banks like CITI , Didnt partner with Google , they afraid google may collect 
		   customers spending strategy. 
		4. Verizon will keep the customer data secured. It will not track  their spending analytics and personal data.

How secured it is ? 

		1.  Finger Print validation
		2.  6 digit pin number validation
		3.  In case of lost or stolen , We track the phone using the "Find my Phone"
		4.  We can lock the payment app by Self-Service options My Verizon , IVR or by calling the customer care center
